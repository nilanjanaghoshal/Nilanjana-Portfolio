[Project 1: Fraud-Detection-Analysis-for-Banking-Transactions](https://github.com/nilanjanaghoshal/Fraud-Detection-Analysis-for-Banking-Transactions)

This Python script aims to predict fraudulent activity in banking transactions using a dataset of credit card transactions. It uses a logistic regression model to identify the fraudulent transactions. This Python script aims to predict fraudulent activity in banking transactions using a dataset of credit card transactions. It uses a logistic regression model to identify the fraudulent transactions.

1) Explored the dataset by printing first few rows, obtaining summary statistics using describe() method, and checking for missing values.

2) Visualized the distribution of classes using a count plot and create a correlation matrix using a heatmap plot to determine correlation between features.

3) Used box plots to compare the distribution of amounts for fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, visualize the distribution of time using a histogram, and use histograms to plot the distribution of each feature.

4) Split the dataset into training and testing sets and create a logistic regression model.

5) Train the model on the training data and predict the classes of the test data.

6) Evaluated the accuracy of the model by calculating the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

7) The final result is a logistic regression model that can detect fraudulent activity in banking transactions with high accuracy, which can help reduce losses from fraudulent activities and increase overall fraud prevention.
