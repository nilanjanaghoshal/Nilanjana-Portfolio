[Project 1: Fraud Detection Analysis for Banking Transactions](https://github.com/nilanjanaghoshal/Fraud-Detection-Analysis-for-Banking-Transactions)

Summary:

The Python script reads a dataset of credit card transactions from a CSV file and performs various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to understand the distribution and correlation of the data features. It then splits the dataset into training and testing sets and creates a logistic regression model to detect fraudulent activities in banking transactions. Finally, the script evaluates the accuracy of the model and presents the results as classification metrics.

Results:

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy score of 99.8%, which indicates a high level of accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions. The confusion matrix and classification report showed that the model had a high detection rate for fraudulent transactions, with a low false-positive rate. By implementing this type of analysis, banks can reduce their losses from fraudulent activities and increase overall fraud prevention.

In summary, the script provides a useful approach for detecting fraudulent activities in banking transactions using a logistic regression model. This approach can be beneficial for banks to minimize their losses from fraudulent activities and improve their fraud prevention systems.

[Project 2: Investing in houses at Nashville](https://github.com/nilanjanaghoshal/Nashville_house_price-prediction)

Summary:

This report analyzes a housing dataset for a real estate firm looking to invest in Nashville. The goal is to create a model that can help locate the best investment opportunities. The report includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and modeling using four different algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, and XGBoost. The analysis aims to identify the most significant variables that impact the sale price compared to value.

Results:

The report identifies several potential variables that could be considered while making an investment decision, including land value, building value, finished area, and full bath. The data shows that there were more houses reported as overpriced than underpriced and that June 2015 had the most sales. There is a large difference between the average value of certain numerical columns, indicating the presence of outliers. The boxplots help to identify the types of houses and areas to focus on when making investment decisions. Finally, the heatmap shows positive correlations between land value, building value, finished area, and full bath, confirming their potential as significant variables.
